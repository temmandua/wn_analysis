How do I even use Turkish WordNet and the others?

- HuWN easy (?), reading in the xml and doing shittery…
	- but not with wn: invalid lexical source
- MonWN .tsv

next time:

- search for Korean/Vietnamese/Persian - maybe reach out?
- try finding out how to go forth with Turkish WordNet, only one that has python code...
- see if u can analyse Mongolian df, probably easier than HuWN
- take notes for questions 31.10., How to proceed with all the formats?

idea for the formats:
- Mongolian tsv: code to convert it into xml / WN-LMF 1.3?
- same with HuWN?

also... wn / nltk / KeNet … chaotic
- which do I need for what?
- can use NLTK for all the languages from omw 1.4

managed to get files for Vietnamese wordnet… but without context to English?
- separate csv files for pos and sem fields

found KorEDA: a tool for … idk
- seems to have something to do with CoreNet, can I use it somehow?
NOW pretty sure I found a python code containing CoreNet … can I use it? am I allowed to use it?

found FarsNet:
- website with sign in, licences etc … afaik 2 options: online use, or use of project offline
- matter of licences: is it fine for me to use offline version in my thesis?

QUESTIONS FOR 31.10.

1 some languages have synset relations to the english one
- how do we deal with the ones that don't? eg. Mongolian?
- in other terms: how do we determine a word's reading?
	for turkish: ili-mapping.txt

2 how do we take care of word inflection?
- likely that there are tools… but for all languages?


Turkish problem:
- the synonyms are not separately distinguished from the multiword expressions...
